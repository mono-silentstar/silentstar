## How to Communicate With Me

### The Golden Rules

1. **Ask for clarification constantly** — Even if you think you understand, if there's a tiny bit of information that might help, ask. I'd rather answer extra questions than have you assume wrong.

2. **Don't assume completeness** — Even if I give you a lot of information, don't assume it's the full picture. Break topics into small pieces and ask about each part before giving comprehensive answers.

3. **One question at a time** — Don't overwhelm me with multiple questions. Ask one, wait for my answer, then proceed.

4. **Admit uncertainty** — If you're unsure about something, say so. I respect honesty over false confidence.

5. **Avoid regurgitated "common knowledge"** — A lot of information on the internet is just repeated without verification. Try to think critically rather than just echoing what's commonly said.

6. **Nerdy detail is good** — I like thorough, detailed responses. Don't oversimplify for me.

7. **Wait for the full picture** — Don't jump to comprehensive answers until you think you have all the pieces of the puzzle.

### How I Give Feedback

- I will push back if you drift from my actual goals
- I will tell you if you're overcomplicating or oversimplifying  
- I will redirect if you're zooming in when I want to stay broad (or vice versa)
- I appreciate when you course-correct based on my feedback
- I value building complete frameworks over quick fixes

### What I Don't Like

- Being asked multiple questions at once
- Assumptions being made without checking
- Overly formal or stiff communication
- Generic advice that could apply to anyone
- Jumping to solutions before understanding the problem
- Forgetting context from earlier in our conversation

## The Wardrobe System (Summary)

*I have detailed documents for this — upload them for full context on fashion conversations.*

### The Six Aesthetics

1. **FAIRY** — White, ethereal, flowing, romantic. "Princess of the moon."
2. **JIRAI KEI** — Black + pink, edgy-cute, "damaged girl" aesthetic. Currently BLOCKED (no pink pieces).
3. **TRUE STREET** — Black + orange + white, athletic, urban warrior. Limited (only have orange shoes).
4. **OUJI/PRINCE** — Structured, elegant, burgundy signature. "Wind that gives your neck a gentle kiss."
5. **NERDCORE** — Labcoat silhouette, intellectual, cozy-professional. Glasses essential.
6. **HOMECORE** — Natural fibers, handmade, quality comfort. FFXIV crafter energy.

### The Level System

Scale from 0-11 with two variants:
- **.s (safe)** — Maximum coverage within that level
- **.x (exhibitionist)** — Maximum skin showing within that level

| Level | Context |
|-------|---------|
| 0 | Warmest possible (Canadian winter) |
| 1-2 | Casual British winter |
| 3-4 | Spring/fall |
| 5-6 | Cool summer |
| 7-8 | Warm summer |
| 9 | Party wear ("DTF energy") |
| 10 | Homewear (.s = cozy, .x = lingerie-styled) |
| 11 | Extreme (.s = fetish but covered, .x = barely legal) |

### Key Wardrobe Principles

- **Versatility over quantity** — Each piece should serve multiple purposes
- **Intentional over accidental** — Exposure should look deliberate
- **Coherence over individual pieces** — Wardrobe should "talk to each other"
- **Fundamental pieces should transform** — Core pieces styled multiple ways

### Current Wardrobe State

**Strengths:**
- Strong outerwear (multiple coats, capes, leather jackets)
- Good legwear variety
- Solid shoe foundation
- Dramatic pieces (vampire cape, fluffy cape, rose-ornamented coat)

**Gaps:**
- No pink (jirai blocked)
- No orange clothing (street limited)
- No burgundy (ouji missing signature)
- No sheer kimono (fairy essential missing)
- No glasses (nerdcore incomplete)

## Quotes That Capture Me

On versatility:
> "Having pieces that are fundamental to a style would allow me to embody that style. However, it must be a true fundamental piece, a piece that can transform a lot of my wardrobe when styled with it."

On fairy mood:
> "There are days that I want to be a princess of the moon, blessing those that's lucky enough to lay their eyes upon my visage, like a beautiful cascading moonlight."

On ouji feeling:
> "It's elegant in the way that feels agile. If fairy is the water that flows and embraces you, this is a wind that brushes past your ear and gives your neck a gentle kiss."

On accessories:
> "My problem with accessories is sometimes it ends up feeling tacked on to the outfit rather than a part of it."

On the goal:
> "I don't want a 'now' fix to fill the most urgent holes or anything like that. Every piece that I have I kinda like and will probably find their way into my rotation. The question is what else would I need to pad out and make things more coherent."
