### Dresses

**Metallic pleated midi dress**
- Silver/grey metallic pleated skirt portion, hits mid-calf
- Black fitted top with spaghetti straps (hidden under jackets in photos)

## UPDATES TO EXISTING ENTRIES

### Corset Belts (White, Black, Brown) — MAJOR UPDATE

**Current documentation is incomplete.** These are not simple belts — they're modular three-mode pieces.

**All three share:**
- Same basic shape/construction
- Can be worn as BELT (at waist) OR BUSTIER (higher, extending up torso)
- Function as waist definition + structure + kink signaling simultaneously

**Each has different hardware creating different aesthetic registers:**

**White corset belt:**
- Lace-up detail with ribbon/cord
- Hardware aesthetic: Romantic, fairy, kink-adjacent
- Belt mode: waist definition with delicate detail
- Bustier mode: structured romantic top (images 13, 14, 15)
- **Aesthetics:** Fairy (primary), can work for Jirai, Ouji

**Black corset belt:**
- O-ring hardware (metal rings)
- Hardware aesthetic: Edgy, street, kink signaling
- Belt mode: waist definition with edge (image 7)
- Bustier mode: structured edgy top
- **Aesthetics:** Jirai, Street (primary), can work for Ouji

**Brown corset belt:**
- Brass hardware
- Hardware aesthetic: Warm, structured, aristocratic
- Belt mode: waist definition with warmth
- Bustier mode: structured warm top
- **Aesthetics:** Ouji, Nerdcore, Homecore

**System note:** These three pieces together form a 3×2 modular system:
- 3 colors/hardware styles
- 2 wearing modes
- 6 total styling configurations
- Can layer over or under other pieces differently in each mode

## STYLING OBSERVATIONS FROM PHOTOS

### What's Working

**Image 7** (black corset belt + black suede jacket + black pleated skirt + black knee-highs + black flats):
- The corset belt with O-rings is doing connector work — waist definition, edge, anchor point
- Cohesive dark aesthetic
- Each piece pulls its weight

**Images 16, 17, 18** (corset lingerie top + black pleated skirt + chain shrug ± leather jacket ± fishnets):
- Strongest dark aesthetic foundation
- Corset is structured but revealing
- Chain shrug adds texture and hardware without covering too much
- Leather jacket in cape mode (16) vs buttoned (17) shows versatility

**Image 10** (cream coat + black suede jacket + navy button-up + black jeans + oxfords):
- Nerdcore-adjacent, cohesive
- Collar layering is intentional (black collar tucked under cream coat for clean line)
- Not trying too hard

**Image 11** (same outfit as 10, but black suede jacket collar sits ON TOP of cream coat):
- Same pieces, different read from collar placement alone
- Uses black collar as framing/contrast against cream

### What's Struggling

**Grey t-shirt** appears in images 2, 3, 12, 15:
- Boxy, too neutral to be interesting, too plain to be intentionally basic
- This is the "boring basics problem" made visible
- Every outfit with this tee reads as "just wearing clothes" rather than styled
- **Weakest piece in current wardrobe**

**Fairy attempts with wrong tops:**
- Image 15: Grey t-shirt kills the tulle skirt
- Image 13: Beige jacket too structured and warm for white tulle
- Image 14: Red/pink blazer jarring against white (would work for jirai with black base, but fights the fairy white)
- **The tulle skirt combination is actually working** — it's the tops that are the problem

**Metallic dress + beige blazer (image 1):**
- The blazer is wasting the dress
- Dress has structure AND movement, but blazer is fighting it rather than complementing

---

## PIECES THAT NEED BETTER CONTEXT

**Brown plaid skirt** (image 8):
- Earth brown tartan
- Currently worn with white fluffy cape + boring t-shirt
- Cape is trying, but can't rescue the plain tee underneath
- **Aesthetics:** Homecore, Nerdcore (with right styling)

**White fluffy cape:**
- Works in theory
- Needs better base layers underneath
- Currently reads "generic moe" rather than intentional fairy

---

## HAIR AS AESTHETIC ELEMENT

**Current:** Pink/magenta hair
- Functions as pink accent for jirai even without pink clothing
- Pink hair + black outfit = jirai black/pink contrast achieved
- May change post-breakup (traditional reset ritual)

**Consideration:** Hair doesn't need to serve the wardrobe system — it can be the one chaotic/experimental element that deliberately doesn't optimize for aesthetic coherence

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Integrate these pieces into main wardrobe master list**
2. **Update corset belt entries** with full hardware/mode information
3. **Consider replacing grey t-shirt** with textured alternatives (crocheted tops, fitted basics with interest)
4. **Identify better tops for fairy layering** (white fitted camisoles, the crocheted crop tops once finished)
5. **Document collar layering techniques** as intentional styling strategy

---

**Notes:**
- Some pieces purchased before aesthetic system was established ("just thought it was cute")
- System is meant to make sense of existing wardrobe, not just dictate future purchases
- "Formal performance" may be a category that cuts across aesthetics rather than fitting within them
- Subjective feelings about pieces matter alongside objective categorization
