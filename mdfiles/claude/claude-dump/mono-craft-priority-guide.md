# Mono's Craft Priority Guide

*What to make, in what order, to unlock the most wardrobe potential.*

---

## Your Starting Point

**Current skills:**
- Knit/Crochet: Beginner, small projects completed, first garment (crocheted crop top) in progress
- Sewing: Hand sewing only, comfortable with joining stitches, pattern cutting is new

**What you have ready:**
- Yarn: white merino, grey ryland, brown manx loghtan
- Yarn needed: black (waiting for right source)
- Sewing patterns: Books with patterns (multi-pattern pages, need to learn to use)
- No sewing machine (hand sewing only)

---

## The Logic

Projects are prioritized by:
1. **Skill match** — Can you do this now, or does it require learning?
2. **Materials ready** — Do you have what you need?
3. **Unlock value** — How much of your wardrobe becomes usable?
4. **Time investment** — Hand sewing is slower; account for this

---

## PHASE 1: Current Projects (Finish What You Started)

### 1.1 — Crocheted Fitted Crop Top (White)
**Status:** In progress  
**Yarn:** White merino (have it)  
**Skill:** Beginner-intermediate crochet  

**Why finish this first:**
- You've already started — momentum matters
- Tests the pattern before making more
- Immediately unlocks: white fluffy cape styling, base for fairy aesthetic
- Learn fit adjustments before committing more yarn

**What it unlocks:**
- White fluffy cape → now has a textured base that feels intentional
- Transparent white cape → something worth seeing through
- Foundation for fairy aesthetic at multiple levels
- Can layer under waistcoat for textured neckline

---

## PHASE 2: Repeat Success (Same Pattern, Different Colors)

Once the white top works, make the same pattern in other colors. This is efficient because you've already solved the construction — now you're just changing yarn.

### 2.1 — Crocheted Fitted Crop Top (Grey)
**Yarn:** Grey ryland (have it)  
**Skill:** Same as white — you know this now  

**What it unlocks:**
- Nerdcore base layer
- Homecore base layer
- Neutral option under darker outerwear
- Under blue waistcoat (tonal layering)

### 2.2 — Crocheted Fitted Crop Top (Brown/Camel)
**Yarn:** Manx loghtan (have it)  
**Skill:** Same pattern  

**What it unlocks:**
- Works with brown skirt and skort you own
- Works with brown leather coat
- Warm neutral option
- Homecore earth tones

### 2.3 — Crocheted Fitted Crop Top (Black)
**Yarn:** TBD — waiting for right source  
**Skill:** Same pattern  

**What it unlocks:**
- THE most versatile — works under almost everything
- Vampire cape finally has a worthy base layer
- Under leather jackets
- Under blue waistcoat
- Jirai base (still needs pink but black foundation is there)
- Street base
- Under all your black outerwear

**Note:** Don't rush the yarn sourcing. This is worth waiting for the right one.

## PHASE 3: First Sewing Projects (Learn Pattern Cutting)

These are chosen because:
- Simple shapes (rectangles, minimal cutting)
- Hand sewing friendly (few seams, simple finishing)
- High impact (unlocks a lot for relatively little work)
- Forgiving fabrics (hides imperfection)

### 3.1 — Ribbon Accessories (Chokers, Hair Ribbons, Bracelets)
**Materials:** Ribbon (buy a few meters of velvet and satin in black, white, pink)  
**Skill:** Absolute beginner — just cutting and attaching closures  
**Time:** 30 minutes each  

**Why start here:**
- Zero pattern cutting needed
- Immediate gratification
- Learn to attach closures (snaps, hooks)
- Pink ribbon = first pink in your wardrobe (unlocks jirai signaling!)

**What to make:**
- [ ] Black velvet choker
- [ ] White lace choker (buy lace trim, same construction)
- [ ] Pink velvet choker *(first jirai piece!)*
- [ ] White satin hair ribbon
- [ ] Black satin hair ribbon
- [ ] Pink satin hair ribbon

**What it unlocks:**

**Skill:** Cutting rectangles, straight seams  
**Time:** Several hours to a day (hand sewing)  

**Why this is your first "real" sewing project:**
- Construction is literally rectangles — two front panels, one back panel, two sleeves
- No curves, no darts, no fitting
- No closures needed (worn open)
- Sheer fabric is forgiving (slight imperfections less visible)
- French seams work beautifully by hand and give clean finish
- THIS IS THE FAIRY ESSENTIAL PIECE

**Pattern approach:**
