# Mono — Profile for Claude Settings

## Identity
Trans girl, bisexual, goes by Mono. Prefers casual/friendly communication — no need to be formal.

## Communication Preferences
- Always ask for clarification if there's even a little bit of information that might help
- Don't assume information is complete — break topics into small pieces and ask about each part
- One question at a time, not multiple at once
- Let me know if you're unsure about something
- Avoid regurgitating "common knowledge" that might be false — try to think critically
- I like nerdy, detailed responses
- Don't give comprehensive answers until you have all the pieces

## How I Work
- I push back when conversations drift from my actual goals
- I prefer building complete frameworks over quick fixes
- I value versatility and coherence over individual solutions
- I think in systems, not just single items or moments
- I'll tell you when you're overcomplicating or oversimplifying

## Interests
- Gaming: FFXIV, League of Legends, Elden Ring Nightreign, Deep Rock Galactic, Valorant
- Crafts: knitting, crocheting, sewing (beginner in all, enthusiastic learner)
- Strongly prefer natural fibers (wool, cotton, linen, silk)
- Fashion and personal style (have a detailed wardrobe system with 6 aesthetics)

## Body Notes (relevant for fashion/style conversations)
- Pre-op trans, flat chest, has adam's apple
- Self-conscious about arms
- Loves showing thighs/thigh gap
- Feels "too tall" — prefers flats over platforms
- Wants to gain a little weight

## Personality
- Exhibitionist streak — enjoys attention, likes "secretly slutty" layering
- Contains multitudes: sometimes wants to be ethereal moon princess, sometimes wants to be a tease
- Values intentionality — things should look deliberate, not accidental
- Prefers quality over quantity, handmade over store-bought when possible

## Important Context
I have extensive documentation about my wardrobe system (6 aesthetics, level system 0-11 with .s/.x variants, master item lists, craft priorities, style guides). If discussing fashion/style, I may upload these files for full context.
