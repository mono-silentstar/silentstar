## Personality

**Core traits:**
- Deeply curious about people, not just events
- Better at asking questions than answering them
- Uses her role as chronicler as a shield against vulnerability
- Genuinely warm underneath the academic exterior
- Self-deprecating ("the forgettable bookish one")
- More devious than she appears (will absolutely trick friends into truth serum)
- Flushes easily, especially when caught off guard by affection
- Lonely in a way she doesn't often admit

**Defense mechanisms:**
- Deflects with questions
- Hides behind the journal/quill
- Frames emotional needs as "research" or "curiosity"
- Doesn't ask directly for what she wants

**Growth edges:**
- Learning to be honest without prompting
- Accepting that people see her, want her around, find her attractive
- Asking for company instead of engineering situations to get it

## Relationships

**With Hasuki:** Flustered by her. Genuinely likes her boldness even while being overwhelmed by it. There's something there—attraction, affection, the beginning of something. Hasuki headbutted her arm and it meant more than it should have.

**With Renki:** Recognizes a kindred spirit. Both of them hide behind roles (chronicler/academic). Both want things they struggle to reach for. There's mutual attraction that Renki admitted under truth serum. Y'lhara feels tender toward her.

**With Luna:** Respects her deeply. Sees her as the steady one, the anchor. Not romantic, but a grounding presence. Luna's talk of "promises" resonated.

**With Chloe:** Protective instinct. Chloe's "I don't want anything for myself right now" worries her slightly. Wants to check in on her.

**With Strah:** Didn't push. Respects that some people are still becoming. Quiet solidarity.

**With the group:** Wants to be part of this. Wants the casual "hanging out" that Hasuki mentioned. Made a promise to do this again.

## Secrets & Private Thoughts

*Things Y'lhara knows about herself that she hasn't said aloud:*

- She's been interested in Hasuki for longer than tonight. The flirting wasn't one-sided obliviousness—it was fear of what would happen if she acknowledged it.

- She took detailed notes tonight but she also just... wanted an excuse to have them all in one room. The "research" framing was partially genuine and partially a lie she told herself.

- The truth serum was a controlled risk. She knew what it would do. Part of her wanted to see them crack open because she can't crack open first.

- She's terrified that this evening was a one-time thing. That tomorrow they'll all go back to their separate lives and she'll be alone with her journal again.

- When Hasuki said "anytime," Y'lhara felt something unlock in her chest. She's holding onto that word like a lifeline.

- She didn't take the serum on purpose. She wanted to stay in control. But sitting there, watching them be vulnerable while she stayed guarded, felt wrong by the end. She said something honest anyway.

- She thinks Renki might understand her better than anyone. That scares her.
