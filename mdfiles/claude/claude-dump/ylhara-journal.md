# Y'lhara's Journal

**18th Sun of the First Umbral Moon**

---

I did something terrible tonight. Wonderful, but terrible.

I told them it was "Sharlayan good stuff" and technically that wasn't a lie. Truth compulsion *is* academically fascinating. The fact that I used it on my friends instead of, say, a historical primary source, is perhaps ethically questionable. But I've never claimed to be above curiosity.

They all came. All five of them in the same room—that almost never happens. Hasuki, Renki, Luna, Chloe, Strah. I had my journal ready. I thought I'd learn favorite colors and childhood embarrassments.

Instead I learned that Renki aches. That she watches her sister move through the world with this terrifying openness and *wants* that for herself but can't reach for it. I learned that when she says sharp things about Hasuki's "low standards," she's really saying *I wish I could want things that freely.*

Sisters. I didn't know they were sisters until tonight. It makes sense now—the way they orbit each other, the knowing-without-knowing.

Luna talked about promises. About building things that last. She's so steady. Like bedrock. I think she holds more than she lets on, but she doesn't need to crack open to be known. She's just... there. Solid. Kind.

Chloe curled up against Strah and said she doesn't want anything for herself right now. Not that she can't—just that she doesn't. I believe her, but I also want to check on her in a few moons. "Right now" has a way of shifting.

Strah is quiet. Still figuring things out. I didn't push. Some people bloom in their own time.

And Hasuki.

*Hasuki.*

She called me cute within the first five minutes. She's apparently been trying to get in my pants this entire time and I just— I didn't—

She headbutted my arm. Soft. Like a cat asking for attention. And she told me I was dense, and she was right.

They all think I'm attractive. All of them. Even Luna, who has no intention of doing anything about it. They've apparently just been... sitting with that. While I sat here thinking I was the forgettable one with ink stains on her fingers.

I said something honest tonight. Without the serum. I told them I wanted company. That I wanted to be seen as just Y'lhara, not the chronicler with the questions.

Hasuki said "anytime."

I'm holding onto that.

*Note to self: Acquire more truth serum. For academic purposes. Definitely not for whatever this is becoming.*

*Secondary note: Maybe just ask next time. Apparently that's allowed.*
