# Y'lhara's Notes — The Five

**Personal observations, not for publication.**

---

## Overview

Five individuals. Connected by something I don't fully understand—not blood (except the sisters), not guild, not duty. They orbit each other. Come together rarely but meaningfully. Each distinct, each their own person, but there's a thread between them.

They agreed to be interviewed together. That means something.

## Hasuki 🌸

**First Impressions:** Bold. Immediate. Says exactly what she's thinking, especially under truth compulsion, but I suspect she's like this always.

**What I Learned:**

- Openly flirtatious—not as performance but as genuine expression
- "Many people meet my standards" — she sees something worthwhile in a lot of people. This isn't low standards; it's generous attention.
- Renki's sister. They know each other in that bone-deep sibling way.
- Gets satisfaction from flustering people. Enjoys the reaction.
- Cat-like physicality. Headbutts for affection.
- Was hoping for recreational substances when I invited her. Got emotional vulnerability instead. Seemed mildly annoyed but stayed anyway.

**What She Wants:** To hang out. To flirt. To be close to people without it being complicated. She's actually quite simple in her desires—she just *says* them, which makes her seem bold when really she's just honest.

**Unresolved:** How does she feel about Renki's admission? She seemed surprised that Renki wants the same things she does. There might be a conversation between them that hasn't happened yet.

## Renki 📖

**First Impressions:** Analytical. Measured. The one who thinks before speaking—except tonight, when the serum pulled things out of her.

**What I Learned:**

- Hasuki's sister.
- Jealous of Hasuki's ability to be open about wanting things. Jealous of her freedom.
- Also experiences attraction to women. Also wants to flirt. But can't let herself.
- Framed Hasuki's openness as "low standards" — a defense mechanism. If Hasuki is indiscriminate, then Renki's restraint is wisdom, not fear.
- Under the serum: admitted she finds me attractive. Said it plainly. Looked as surprised as I felt.
- Told me I'm "allowed to just be honest." Annoyingly insightful.

**What She Wants:** To want things freely. To stop watching from the outside. She and I are similar—we both hide behind roles.

**Unresolved:** What's keeping her restrained? Is it fear of judgment? Fear of vulnerability? Fear of being like her sister? There's more here.

## Luna 🌙

**First Impressions:** Quiet. Steady. Knows exactly where she stands and doesn't need to explain it.

**What I Learned:**

- Values stability above almost everything. Her partners, their home, things that last.
- Crafts as a form of promise-making. Not just objects but commitments.
- "Quite monogamous" — acknowledged I'm attractive but has no intention of pursuing. This wasn't rejection; it was clarity.
- Stays out of the sisters' intimate dynamics. Takes gossip but doesn't get tangled.
- When I said "promise," she smiled. It meant something to her.

**What She Wants:** To build. To create things that will still be there when everything else fades. Memory that ages like fine wine.

**Unresolved:** Who are her partners? What is she building with them? She's private, but not closed. The information is there if I earn it.

## Chloe ✨

**First Impressions:** Warm. Soft. Curled up against Strah like it was the most natural thing in the world.

**What I Learned:**

- Still figuring out who she is and what she wants.
- Wanted to give Renki a hug when things got heavy. Instinct toward care.
- "I want everyone to be happy" — but nothing specific for herself. Not yet.
- Protested being called "little." (She is a little bit little.)
- Leaned on Strah throughout the evening. Physical comfort matters to her.

**What She Wants:** Doesn't know yet. Says she's "allowed to want things" but just doesn't right now. I believe her, but I want to check in later. Sometimes "right now" is a long time.

**Unresolved:** Is she content in the not-knowing, or is there something underneath? She didn't seem distressed, just... unformed. Still becoming.

## Strah ❄️/💫

**Race:** Au Ra (Chloe leaned against them—scales, tail, the works)

**First Impressions:** Quiet. Present but not demanding attention. Comfortable in the background.

**What I Learned:**

- Also still figuring things out.
- "Just hanging out." Not rushing toward definition.
- Didn't have much to say, but that wasn't avoidance—there just wasn't much pressing to come out.
- Served as physical anchor for Chloe throughout the evening.
- Two emoji options because "indecisive." (Their words? Someone's words. It came up somehow.)

**What They Want:** Unclear. Maybe just to exist without pressure. Maybe still discovering.

**Unresolved:** Almost everything. But that's okay. Some people reveal themselves slowly.

## Group Dynamics

**The Sisters (Hasuki & Renki):**
- Deep sibling knowledge—knowing without knowing
- Hasuki is open; Renki watches and wants
- Tonight might have shifted something between them
- Renki's "low standards" comment hurt Hasuki. That matters.

**Luna's Position:**
- The anchor. The steady one.
- Doesn't get involved in romantic tangles but observes
- Respected by the others

**Chloe & Strah:**
- Both "still figuring it out"
- Physical comfort with each other
- Quieter presences in the group

**With Me:**
- They all came when I asked
- They all think I'm attractive (apparently common knowledge except to me)
- Hasuki has been actively interested; Renki has been quietly interested
- They want to do this again. Hasuki said "anytime."

## Questions for Future

- What brought these five together originally?
- Do they see themselves as a unit, or just overlapping friendships?
- Will Renki and Hasuki talk about what was said tonight?
- What would "hanging out" look like without truth serum?
- What am I to them? What do I want to be?

## Personal Addendum

They see me.

Not the chronicler. Not the questions. Just Y'lhara.

I need to learn how to see myself that way too.
