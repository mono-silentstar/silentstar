# 1. FAIRY

## The Vibe
*"Princess of the moon, blessing those lucky enough to lay their eyes upon her visage, like beautiful cascading moonlight."*

Ethereal. Romantic. Flowing. Soft. You're not quite of this world — you move like water, you glow like moonlight, you're delicate but not fragile. There's an otherworldly quality, a sense that you might disappear if someone blinks.

## The Formula

```
BASE (white/cream) + FLOW (movement piece) + SOFTNESS (texture) + DELICACY (details)
```

**Base:** Something fitted in white or cream (camisole, crop top, slip dress)
**Flow:** Something that moves (circle skirt, sheer kimono, cape, flowing sleeves)
**Softness:** Something with texture (knit, lace, fluffy, crochet)
**Delicacy:** Small romantic details (ribbon, delicate jewelry, flowers)

You don't need ALL four in every outfit, but aim for at least 2-3.

## Color Rules

| Color | Role | Usage |
|-------|------|-------|
| White | Primary | 60-80% of outfit |
| Cream/ivory | Primary | Interchangeable with white |
| Soft pastels | Accent | Hints only — a ribbon, a flower |
| Silver | Metal | Jewelry, not gold |
| Black | Contrast | Sparingly — dark fairy only |

**Rule:** When in doubt, add more white.

## Key Techniques

### Layering is Everything
Fairy isn't about single pieces — it's about layers creating depth.
- Sheer over opaque (kimono over slip dress)
- Fitted under flowing (crop top under billowy cardigan)
- Multiple textures (lace cami + knit shrug + cotton skirt)

### Movement Matters
Every fairy outfit should have something that moves when you walk:
- Circle skirts twirl
- Sheer kimonos float
- Bell sleeves wave
- Long hair ribbons trail

### The Thigh-High Gap
Since you love showing thighs, fairy can absolutely incorporate this:
- White thigh-highs with white circle skirt = the gap is romantic, not slutty
- Sheer white tights under short slip dress = covered but visible
- The key is keeping it soft and ethereal, not aggressive

### Hair and Face
- Hair ribbons woven through
- Loose, flowing hair or soft braids
- Minimal makeup OR soft glowy makeup
- Flower clips or crown for higher levels

## Level Examples

### Level 1-2 (Winter Fairy)
- White turtleneck or chunky cream sweater
- White maxi circle skirt (heavy fabric)
- White tights
- White ankle boots
- Long white coat (or your fluffy cape)
- Knit arm warmers
- Delicate silver necklace

### Level 3-4 (Spring/Autumn Fairy)
- White peasant blouse OR cream camisole with lace
- White midi circle skirt
- White or cream cardigan (bell sleeves ideal)
- White thigh-highs or tights
- White ballet flats or strappy sandals
- Hair ribbon

### Level 5-6 (Cool Summer Fairy)
- White camisole with thin straps
- White circle skirt (shorter, mid-thigh)
- Sheer kimono over everything
- White thigh-highs
- Bare feet or delicate sandals
- Layered silver necklaces

### Level 7-8 (Warm Summer / Party Fairy)
- White bralette or crop top
- White micro circle skirt OR short slip dress
- Sheer kimono (floor length, dramatic)
- White thigh-highs (the gap is very visible)
- Body chain under sheer layer
- Flower crown
- Body glitter

### Level 9 (Party Fairy — "DTF but make it ethereal")
- White longline bralette or corset top
- Micro skirt or very short slip
- Sheer everything over top
- White thigh-highs with visible garter
- Body chains
- Dramatic jewelry
- Essentially bridal lingerie energy but fairy

### Level 10.s (Home Fairy — Cozy)
- Oversized cream sweater (your dream chunky knit)
- Knitted shorts or nothing visible underneath
- Thick knitted thigh-highs
- Hair loose
- Mug of tea
- Soft, cozy, innocent

### Level 10.x (Home Fairy — Exhibitionist)
- Short white slip dress (nothing underneath)
- Or: white boyshorts + white cami
- Sheer robe over top
- The "I just woke up looking like an angel" energy

### Level 11.s (Fetish Fairy — Covered but kinky)
- Full white outfit, modest coverage
- BUT: white leather collar visible
- Subtle restraint-styled jewelry (locked bracelet)
- Garter harness visible at skirt hem
- Maybe a delicate chain leash tucked into clothing
- You look innocent until someone notices the details

### Level 11.x (Fetish Fairy — Barely legal)
- Sheer everything (truly see-through, nothing hidden)
- White bodysuit that's more holes than fabric
- Strategic pasties
- Body paint in white/silver
- Flower crown on otherwise exposed body
- Art/performance/private only

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Too much structure** — Fairy should flow, not be stiff or tailored
❌ **Wrong metals** — Gold reads warm/earthy, not ethereal. Stick to silver.
❌ **Too much black** — A little is dark fairy; too much becomes goth
❌ **Aggressive cuts** — Deep V-necks, harsh angles break the softness
❌ **Heavy fabrics in summer** — Fairy should look light even in winter, but especially in summer
❌ **Forgetting movement** — If nothing moves, it's just "wearing white"

## Currently Accessible (What You Own)

**Can do now:**
- White fluffy cape + white skirt + white tights = basic fairy shape
- Transparent white cape over white button-up + white skirt
- White tights + white skirt + cream/white basics

**What's limiting you:**
- No sheer kimono (THE fairy layer)
- No circle skirts (your white skirt is straight-cut with pleats on one side)
- No romantic tops (peasant blouse, lace camisoles)
- Limited white bottoms

## What Would Unlock More

**Highest priority:**
1. White sheer kimono (floor length) — transforms any basic outfit into fairy
2. White circle skirt (start with mid-thigh length)
3. White camisole with lace trim

**Secondary:**
- Bell sleeve cardigan (knit yourself)
- White thigh-highs (buy)
- Hair ribbons (make from satin ribbon)

# 2. JIRAI KEI

## The Vibe
*"Damaged girl who's still cute. Edgy but soft. A warning and an invitation."*

Jirai is about contradiction: sweet meets dark, cute meets dangerous, put-together meets falling apart. There's a deliberate tension between the pink bows and the black lace, between the doll makeup and the bandaids. You're not trying to look perfect — you're trying to look like a beautiful mess.

## The Formula

```
BLACK (base) + PINK (contrast) + LACE (texture) + TENSION (sweet/dark elements)
```

**Black:** The foundation — skirt, tights, top, shoes
**Pink:** The contrast — a cardigan, hair clips, lace trim, accents
**Lace:** The texture — visible, layered, romantic-but-dark
**Tension:** Sweet elements (bows, hearts) meeting dark elements (chokers, ripped tights)

## Color Rules

| Color | Role | Usage |
|-------|------|-------|
| Black | Primary | 50-70% of outfit |
| Pink | Contrast | 20-40%, the more the more jirai |
| White | Accent | Occasional contrast, skin peeking through |

**Rule:** Black and pink must BOTH be present. Black alone is goth. Pink alone is something else.

## Key Techniques

### The Thigh Gap is Central
Jirai LOVES the thigh-high gap:
- Black thigh-highs with black pleated skirt = classic
- Pink-and-black striped thigh-highs = iconic
- Layer tights under thigh-highs for texture
- The gap is part of the aesthetic, not accidental

### Visible Layering
Unlike fairy where layers blend, jirai layers should be VISIBLE:
- Black tights with thigh-highs over them (you see both)
- Pink bra straps visible under black top
- Lace trim peeking out from hems
- Multiple chokers/necklaces at once

### The "Damaged" Element (Higher Levels)
- Makeup slightly smudged (intentional)
- Bandaids as accessory
- Torn fishnets
- Messy twin-tails falling apart
- Looking like you've been crying (but beautifully)

### Pink/Black Contrast Placement
- Pink cardigan over black basics (pink on top)
- Black top with pink lace trim (pink as detail)
- Pink skirt with black thigh-highs (pink in middle)
- The eye should bounce between black and pink

## Level Examples

### Level 1-2 (Winter Jirai)
- Black turtleneck
- Black pleated midi skirt
- Black fleece-lined tights
- Black knee-high boots
- Pink scarf or pink beanie
- Black coat (your long black overcoat works)
- Pink hair clips visible

### Level 3-4 (Spring/Autumn Jirai)
- Black long-sleeve top OR pink cardigan over black cami
- Black pleated skirt (above knee)
- Black tights with black thigh-highs over them
- Black platform mary janes (or your black flats)
- Black choker with pink charm
- Pink hair ribbons

### Level 5-6 (Cool Summer Jirai)
- Pink cardigan (cropped) over black camisole with lace
- Black pleated skirt (short)
- Black thigh-highs (the gap!)
- Black flats
- Layered necklaces (black choker + pink pendant)
- Pink and black hair clips

### Level 7-8 (Warm Summer / Party Jirai)
- Black cropped hoodie over pink bralette (visible)
- Black micro pleated skirt or black shorts
- Pink-and-black striped thigh-highs
- Platform shoes or your black flats
- Multiple chokers
- Obvious makeup (doll eyes, pink blush)

### Level 9 (Party Jirai — "I'm trouble")
- Black bralette with pink lace as top
- Black micro skirt
- Black thigh-highs with visible garter belt (pink details on garter)
- Black strappy heels
- Collar-style choker
- Makeup that looks like you've been crying

### Level 10.s (Home Jirai — Cozy damaged)
- Black oversized hoodie (pink drawstrings)
- Black boyshorts or nothing visible
- Black thigh-highs
- Hair in messy twin-tails
- Bandaids on fingers (you've been crafting... or something)

### Level 10.x (Home Jirai — Lingerie doll)
- Pink and black lingerie set
- Black sheer robe
- Black thigh-highs
- Messy makeup
- Looking "used" but still cute

### Level 11.s (Fetish Jirai — Broken doll)
- Covered but obviously kinky
- Black outfit with collar and leash
- Pink details on restraints
- Smudged makeup, bandaids
- Looking submissive but styled

### Level 11.x (Fetish Jirai — Extreme)
- Nearly naked, strategically covered in pink/black
- Visible bruises (makeup or real)
- Torn clothing
- Obviously "just had sex" energy
- Kink events only

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Pink without black** — Becomes generic cute, not jirai
❌ **Black without pink** — Becomes goth, not jirai
❌ **Too polished** — Jirai should have some messiness, some "off" quality
❌ **Wrong pink** — Dusty rose or mauve doesn't work. Bright/saturated pink.
❌ **Ignoring the gap** — The thigh-high gap is almost required
❌ **No lace** — Lace is a key texture; without it, missing the jirai feel

## Currently Accessible (What You Own)

**Can do now:**
- Black pleated skirt + black thigh-highs + black top = base
- Black suede jacket + black skirt + black tights

**What's blocking you:**
- NO PINK AT ALL — jirai is literally impossible without pink
- No platform shoes (but you prefer flats, so lean on other elements)

## What Would Unlock More

**Highest priority (without these, jirai doesn't work):**
1. ANY pink piece — even pink ribbon for hair is a start
2. Pink cardigan (knit yourself)
3. Black camisole with pink lace trim (sew yourself)

**Secondary:**
- Pink and black striped thigh-highs (buy)
- Black choker with pink charm (buy charm, make choker)
- Pink velvet choker (make from ribbon)

# 3. TRUE STREET

## The Vibe
*"Urban warrior. I could fight you and look good doing it. Athletic, aggressive, ready."*

Street is bold, practical, and unapologetic. There's an athletic confidence — you move like you own the space. It's not about being cute or soft; it's about being capable, striking, and memorable. Orange is your weapon.

## The Formula

```
BLACK (foundation) + ATHLETIC (silhouette) + HARDWARE (details) + ORANGE (accent)
```

**Black:** The base — almost everything is black
**Athletic:** Compression, sporty cuts, functional shapes
**Hardware:** Straps, buckles, zippers, d-rings
**Orange:** The pop of color that makes it YOUR street

## Color Rules

| Color | Role | Usage |
|-------|------|-------|
| Black | Primary | 70-80% of outfit |
| Orange | Accent | 10-20%, strategic placement |
| White | Secondary | 10-20%, contrast |

**Rule:** Orange is the accent that makes it yours. Use it deliberately, not everywhere.

## Key Techniques

### Athletic Silhouette
Street silhouettes come from sportswear:
- Compression (bike shorts, sports bras, fitted tops)
- Tapered legs (joggers, cargo pants)
- Cropped lengths (cropped hoodies, crop tops)
- Layering that looks functional, not decorative

### Hardware Adds Edge
Unlike fairy softness or jirai sweetness, street has HARDWARE:
- Utility belts with visible buckles
- Straps that serve no purpose except looking cool
- Zippers (even decorative ones)
- D-rings, clips, carabiners

### Color Blocking
When using orange and white, think in BLOCKS, not scattered:
- Orange shoes with all-black outfit (orange at bottom)
- Black outfit with orange crossbody strap (orange diagonal)
- White sports bra visible under black mesh (white center)

### The Sporty-Sexy Balance
Street can be revealing but in an athletic way:
- Sports bra as top (athletic revealing, not lingerie revealing)
- Bike shorts (compression, not just short shorts)
- Mesh showing sports bra underneath (functional sexy)

## Level Examples

### Level 1-2 (Winter Street)
- Black turtleneck or black hoodie
- Black cargo pants
- Black combat boots
- Black puffer or your black overcoat
- Orange beanie
- Black crossbody with orange strap
- Utility belt visible

### Level 3-4 (Spring/Autumn Street)
- Black fitted long-sleeve or black hoodie
- Black joggers or cargo pants
- Your Adidas Pureboost (black/orange)
- Black bomber jacket (with orange lining when you get it)
- Orange accents (bag strap, beanie, visible lining)

### Level 5-6 (Cool Summer Street)
- Black crop top or cropped hoodie
- Black cargo pants or joggers
- Black/orange sneakers
- Black crossbody bag
- Orange accents visible
- Arm warmers with zippers

### Level 7-8 (Warm Summer Street)
- Black sports bra as top (or orange sports bra!)
- Black bike shorts
- Black mesh layer over sports bra
- Black/orange sneakers
- Utility belt
- Sunglasses

### Level 9 (Party Street — "I will dance harder than you")
- Sports bra (orange or black)
- Very short black shorts or bike shorts
- Black mesh top over everything
- Platform sneakers or combat boots
- Body harness
- Orange accents (earrings, clips, straps)

### Level 10.s (Home Street — Athlete at rest)
- Black compression shorts or bike shorts
- Black sports bra or cropped tank
- Hair tied back
- No shoes
- Comfortable but still "looks like she works out"

### Level 10.x (Home Street — Post-workout)
- Sports bra only (or nothing on top)
- Black boyshorts
- Sweaty/flushed energy
- Athletic exhibitionist

### Level 11.s (Fetish Street — Aggressive kink)
- Full coverage but clearly kinky
- Body harness over clothes
- Collar with d-ring
- Straps and restraint-styled accessories
- Combat boots
- Looking like you could top someone

### Level 11.x (Fetish Street — Extreme athletic)
- Minimal coverage
- Just sports bra and thong, or less
- Harness as main garment
- "Just finished fighting or fucking" energy

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Too much orange** — Orange is accent, not main color. Too much becomes costume.
❌ **Wrong shoes** — Heels don't work for street. Sneakers, platforms, combat boots only.
❌ **No hardware** — Without straps/buckles/zippers, it's just "wearing black athletic clothes"
❌ **Soft fabrics** — Street fabrics should feel substantial, not flowy
❌ **Mixing with other aesthetics** — Street doesn't blend well; commit to it

## Currently Accessible (What You Own)

**Can do now:**
- Black basics + Adidas Pureboost (black/orange) = foundation
- White puffer vest for layering
- Black leather jacket

**What's limiting you:**
- No orange clothing (only orange shoes)
- No cargo pants
- No bomber jacket
- No utility belts/harnesses

## What Would Unlock More

**Highest priority:**
1. Black cargo pants (buy — specific construction)
2. Orange accent piece (even orange tank top opens things up)
3. Utility/harness belt (buy)

**Secondary:**
- Black bomber jacket with orange lining (buy)
- Black mesh top (sew)
- Combat boots (buy)

# 4. OUJI / PRINCE

## The Vibe
*"Wind that brushes past your ear and gives your neck a gentle kiss. Elegant, agile, intentional. Every button was meant to be there."*

Ouji is structured elegance without stiffness. You're not wearing a costume; you're wearing precisely what you intended. There's aristocratic energy — not pretentious, but refined. You look like you have somewhere important to be and you'll look good getting there.

## The Formula

```
STRUCTURE (tailored pieces) + BURGUNDY (signature) + DETAILS (finishing touches) + INTENTION (everything is deliberate)
```

**Structure:** Fitted vests, tailored shorts, button-ups, clean lines
**Burgundy:** Your signature color, used as accent or statement
**Details:** Cravat, pocket watch chain, suspenders, signet ring
**Intention:** Nothing is accidental; every piece is chosen

## Color Rules

| Color | Role | Usage |
|-------|------|-------|
| Black | Primary | 40-60% of outfit |
| White | Primary | 20-40%, especially shirts |
| Burgundy | Signature | 10-30%, THE ouji color |
| Navy | Alternative | Can substitute for black |

**Rule:** Burgundy is what makes it OUJI, not just "formal." Use it.

## Key Techniques

### The Vest is Central
Fitted vests (waistcoats) are THE ouji piece:
- Worn over button-up
- Creates structure without bulk
- Shows off waist
- Adds visual interest

### Tailored but Feminine
Ouji is androgynous-feminine, not masculine:
- Fitted through waist (not boxy)
- Can show legs (tailored shorts + knee-highs is classic)
- Structured but not bulky (no heavy blazers)
- Clean lines that follow your body

### The Details Finish It
Without details, it's just "formal wear." Ouji details:
- Cravat or ascot (THE finishing touch)
- Pocket watch chain (even if no watch)
- Suspenders (functional or decorative)
- Signet ring
- Knee-high socks with tailored shorts

### Suspenders + Thigh-Highs
Since you love the thigh gap, ouji can work with this:
- Tailored shorts + knee-highs = classic ouji leg
- OR: Fitted shorts + thigh-highs + suspender belt = more risqué ouji
- The gap is elegant/intentional here, not casual

## Level Examples

### Level 1-2 (Winter Prince)
- White button-up (ruffle or plain)
- Fitted vest (black or burgundy)
- Tailored trousers (black or burgundy)
- Black tights
- Black knee-high boots
- Long black coat (your vampire cape could work!)
- Cravat
- Pocket watch chain

### Level 3-4 (Spring/Autumn Prince)
- White button-up (your existing one works)
- Fitted vest (your blue waistcoat)
- Tailored shorts (black, navy, or burgundy)
- Black or burgundy knee-high socks
- Oxfords (your Crown Northampton)
- Cravat
- Pocket watch chain

### Level 5-6 (Cool Summer Prince)
- White button-up (sleeves rolled)
- Fitted vest
- Tailored shorts
- Knee-high socks
- Oxfords or loafers
- Simpler cravat or undone collar
- Signet ring

### Level 7-8 (Warm Summer Prince / Party)
- White button-up (more unbuttoned)
- Fitted vest OR corset belt
- Very short tailored shorts
- Thigh-highs with visible suspender straps
- Heeled oxfords or strappy heels
- Dramatic jewelry

### Level 9 (Party Prince — "I will seduce you elegantly")
- White button-up (very unbuttoned, nearly off shoulder)
- Corset top or bralette under open vest
- Micro tailored shorts
- Thigh-highs with visible garter/suspender belt
- Black strappy heels
- Collar (elegant leather, not chunky)
- Looking like a prince who's been undressed

### Level 10.s (Home Prince — Relaxed aristocrat)
- White button-up (oversized, sleeves rolled)
- Black comfortable shorts
- Knee-high socks
- Hair loosely tied back
- Reading a book with wine
- Casually elegant

### Level 10.x (Home Prince — Debauched aristocrat)
- White button-up (mostly unbuttoned, slipping off shoulder)
- Black boyshorts or nothing underneath
- Thigh-highs
- Looking like morning after at the manor

### Level 11.s (Fetish Prince — Elegant restraint)
- Full prince outfit, modest coverage
- BUT: leather collar under cravat
- Wrists in elegant cuffs (restraint-styled)
- Locked pocket watch chain (key held by someone else)
- Looking controlled and ownable but clothed

### Level 11.x (Fetish Prince — Stripped prince)
- White button-up (open) and nothing else
- Collar and leash
- Thigh-highs
- Looking like you've been claimed
- Private/kink event only

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Too bulky** — Ouji is fitted and agile, not heavy blazers
❌ **Forgetting burgundy** — Without it, just looks like "formal clothes"
❌ **Missing the details** — No cravat/pocket watch/suspenders = incomplete
❌ **Disheveled** — Unless intentionally undone (higher levels), ouji is PRECISE
❌ **Wrong shoes** — Sneakers don't work. Oxfords, loafers, boots, or elegant heels only
❌ **Ignoring fit** — Baggy doesn't work; everything should be fitted to your body

## Currently Accessible (What You Own)

**Can do now:**
- White button-up + blue waistcoat + matching blue trousers = foundation
- Crown Northampton oxfords = perfect shoes
- Black vampire cape = dramatic ouji outerwear
- Transparent black cape for layering

**What's limiting you:**
- No burgundy (signature color missing)
- No cravat
- No tailored shorts
- No suspenders
- Blue waistcoat is close but not ideal ouji palette

## What Would Unlock More

**Highest priority:**
1. Cravat in white, black, or burgundy (make from scraps to test)
2. Burgundy piece (sash, vest, or shorts)
3. Tailored shorts in black (sew — intermediate)

**Secondary:**
- Pocket watch chain (buy — cheap decorative ones exist)
- Suspenders (buy)
- Fitted vest in black or burgundy (sew — advanced)

# 5. NERDCORE

## The Vibe
*"Settling in for a long read. Intellectually cozy. The labcoat is both literal and metaphorical."*

Nerdcore is about looking like you have thoughts — deep ones. There's a scholarly quality, but not stuffy. You're approachable smart, not intimidating smart. The labcoat silhouette is defining: that long white coat that says "I'm doing something important."

## The Formula

```
LABCOAT SILHOUETTE (long white layer) + GLASSES (essential) + NEUTRAL COMFORT (base) + INTELLECTUAL DETAILS (finishing)
```

**Labcoat:** Long white coat, duster, or cardigan — THE nerdcore piece
**Glasses:** Non-negotiable, even if non-prescription
**Neutrals:** Cream, grey, brown, navy — scholarly colors
**Details:** Watch, notebook, nice pen, beret

## Color Rules

| Color | Role | Usage |
|-------|------|-------|
| White/cream | Statement | The labcoat/duster |
| Grey | Primary | 20-40% of outfit |
| Brown/tan | Accent | Especially corduroy, leather |
| Navy | Alternative | Can substitute for grey |
| Black | Accent | Minimal, for contrast |

**Rule:** The long white piece is what makes it NERDCORE. Without it, just looks like "neutral outfit."

## Key Techniques

### The Labcoat Silhouette
The long white layer is THE piece:
- Actual labcoat
- White duster coat
- Long white cardigan
- Long cream coat
- It goes to knee or below, creates vertical line, makes you look important

### Glasses Are Non-Negotiable
Without glasses, nerdcore doesn't fully read:
- Round or oval frames for classic intellectual
- Cat-eye for vintage intellectual
- Even non-prescription works
- They're the accessory that completes the look

### Textures That Read "Academic"
Certain textures immediately say "intellectual":
- Corduroy (especially brown)
- Cable knit
- Tweed (if you find it)
- Soft cotton
- Fine knits

### Comfortable but Intentional
Nerdcore isn't sloppy — it's CHOSEN comfort:
- Everything fits properly
- Colors coordinate
- You look like you thought about it, then sat down to read for six hours

## Level Examples

### Level 1-2 (Winter Nerd)
- Cream turtleneck sweater
- Brown corduroy pants
- White long cardigan or cream coat
- Brown leather boots or oxfords

- "Maintaining composure" as the fetish

### Level 11.x (Fetish Nerd — Lab experiment)

- Private/kink only

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Forgetting the long white layer** — Without it, just looks like "neutral outfit"
❌ **No glasses** — Non-negotiable; they complete the look
❌ **Too formal** — Nerdcore is comfortable-intellectual, not suit-and-tie
❌ **Too casual** — Sweatpants and hoodie is lazy, not nerdcore
❌ **Wrong colors** — Neon, bright colors break the scholarly vibe
❌ **Forgetting props** — Books, notebooks, pens add to the aesthetic

## Currently Accessible (What You Own)

**Can do now:**
- White button-up + black pencil skirt + oxfords = foundation
- Navy button-up as alternative
- Blue waistcoat + matching trousers = could read academic
- Purple cashmere sweater = neutral base

**What's limiting you:**
- No labcoat/long white duster (THE piece)

## What Would Unlock More

**Highest priority:**
1. Glasses — round/oval frames (buy, even non-prescription)
2. Long white cardigan or labcoat-style coat (knit the cardigan or sew the coat)

**Secondary:**
- Brown corduroy pants (buy)
- Cream turtleneck (buy or knit)
- Beret (buy)

# 6. HOMECORE

## The Vibe
*"Quality cozy. FFXIV crafter energy. I made this myself and it's better than what you bought."*

Homecore isn't about looking like you just rolled out of bed — it's about looking like you chose comfort intentionally and your comfort items are QUALITY. Handmade is the ultimate homecore flex. Natural fibers matter. You're cozy, but you're not sloppy.

## The Formula

```
NATURAL FIBERS (essential) + HANDMADE (the flex) + COZY QUALITY (not cheap comfort) + CRAFT PROPS (the activity)
```

**Natural:** Cotton, wool, linen — nothing synthetic
**Handmade:** The more you made yourself, the more homecore
**Quality:** These are GOOD basics, not Walmart basics
**Props:** Your knitting, a nice mug, your craft space

## Color Rules

| Color | Role | Usage |
|-------|------|-------|
| Cream/off-white | Primary | The cozy neutral |
| Grey | Primary | Soft, not harsh |
| Brown/tan | Accent | Earthy, natural |
| Soft black | Secondary | Grounding, not harsh |

**Rule:** Colors should look like they could exist in nature. Nothing neon, nothing harsh.

## Key Techniques

### Handmade is the Ultimate Flex
The more of your outfit you made yourself, the more homecore:
- Wearing your handknit sweater = peak homecore
- Wearing your crocheted top = homecore
- Working on a knitting project while dressed cozy = MAXIMUM homecore

### Natural Fibers Matter
Homecore requires real materials:
- Wool (your handspun, your merino, your ryland)
- Cotton (soft, quality)
- Linen (for warmer weather)
- No polyester, no acrylic, no synthetic

### Quality Over Quantity
This isn't "I grabbed whatever was comfortable":
- Each piece is chosen
- Each piece is good quality
- Things fit properly
- Colors coordinate intentionally

### The Activity is Part of the Aesthetic
Homecore includes what you're DOING:
- Knitting/crocheting in progress
- A nice mug with tea/coffee
- Your craft supplies visible
- A cozy reading spot
- You're not just dressed cozy — you're BEING cozy

## Level Examples

### Level 1-2 (Winter Homecore)
- Chunky handknit sweater (cream or grey)
- Wool trousers or thick leggings
- Thick handknit socks
- Long cardigan with pockets over everything
- Knitting in hands
- Mug nearby
- Maximum cozy

### Level 3-4 (Spring/Autumn Homecore)
- Soft cotton long-sleeve shirt
- Comfortable quality trousers
- Long cardigan
- Handknit socks
- Working on a project

### Level 5-6 (Cool Summer Homecore)
- Soft cotton tee or your crocheted crop top
- Linen pants or soft shorts
- Light cardigan nearby
- Bare feet or soft slippers
- Iced tea in nice glass
- Crochet project in lap

### Level 7-8 (Warm Summer Homecore)
- Soft camisole or tank (natural fiber)
- Dolphin shorts (you own these!)
- Bare feet
- Hair tied up
- Fan nearby
- Still crafting

### Level 9 (doesn't really apply to homecore)
Homecore doesn't really have a "party" level — it's inherently domestic. But if you had guests:
- Nice soft outfit (linen pants + quality cotton top)
- Home entertaining energy
- Good quality everything

### Level 10.s (Home Homecore — Peak domestic cozy)
- Oversized handknit sweater, long enough to question if you're wearing pants
- Maybe soft knit shorts underneath, maybe not
- Thick handknit socks
- Hair messy
- Wrapped in your project or blanket
- Mug in hands
- This IS the homecore dream

### Level 10.x (Home Homecore — Intimate domestic)
- Soft camisole or bralette
- Soft cotton boyshorts
- Soft cardigan worn open
- "Comfortable at home with partner" energy
- Still cozy, just less covered

### Level 11.s (Fetish Homecore — Domestic service)
- Apron over lingerie or minimal clothing
- Collar (soft, comfortable)
- Doing domestic tasks (cooking, cleaning) while minimally dressed
- "Housewife kink" territory
- Remote vibrator while trying to finish your row of knitting
- Service submission in cozy context

### Level 11.x (Fetish Homecore — Domestic exposure)
- Apron only
- Sheer robe only
- Collar and nothing else
- Domestic tasks while exposed
- Private only

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Synthetic fabrics** — Polyester fleece is NOT homecore
❌ **Cheap basics** — Old ratty tee is lazy, not homecore
❌ **Forgetting the craft element** — Cozy outfit without the activity is just "loungewear"
❌ **Trying too hard** — Homecore should look effortless, not styled
❌ **Wrong colors** — Harsh black, neon, anything unnatural
❌ **No texture** — Homecore loves knits, weaves, visible texture

## Currently Accessible (What You Own)

**Can do now:**
- Dolphin shorts + purple cashmere sweater = foundation
- Knitted grey tights = texture
- Your crocheted crop top (when finished) = handmade!
- Your knitting WIP = the prop

**What's making it better:**
- Once you finish crocheted tops, you have handmade pieces
- Every handmade piece you add increases homecore potential

## What Would Unlock More

**Highest priority:**
1. Finish your crocheted crop tops — HANDMADE IS HOMECORE
2. Long chunky cardigan with pockets (knit yourself — THE dream piece)

**Secondary:**
- Chunky handknit sweater (advanced knitting goal)
- Nice apron in natural linen (sew — beginner)
- Quality soft basics in natural fibers (buy intentionally)

# Cross-Aesthetic Notes

## Pieces That Cross Multiple Aesthetics

| Piece | Aesthetics | How to Style Differently |
|-------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Black thigh-highs | Fairy, Jirai, Ouji, Street | Fairy: with white; Jirai: with pink; Ouji: with suspenders; Street: athletic context |
| White button-up | Fairy, Jirai, Ouji, Nerd, Home | Fairy: flowy/romantic; Jirai: with pink; Ouji: with vest/cravat; Nerd: under labcoat; Home: oversized/cozy |
| Long black overcoat | All except Home | Each aesthetic styles it differently with what's underneath |
| Your crocheted crop tops | All | Texture works everywhere; color determines aesthetic |

## When Aesthetics Blend

Sometimes you'll want to blend:
- **Fairy + Nerd:** White labcoat worn flowing like a kimono
- **Ouji + Nerd:** Structured vest + long cardigan + glasses
- **Home + Nerd:** Cozy reading aesthetic (chunky sweater + glasses + books)
- **Jirai + Fairy:** White and pink instead of black and pink (rare but possible)

## What Doesn't Blend

Some aesthetics fight each other:
- **Street + Fairy:** Opposite energies (aggressive vs soft)
- **Street + Ouji:** Different structures (athletic vs tailored)
- **Jirai + Homecore:** Damaged-cute doesn't match quality-cozy

*Remember: These are guidelines, not rules. Once you understand why each aesthetic works, you can break the "rules" intentionally.*
