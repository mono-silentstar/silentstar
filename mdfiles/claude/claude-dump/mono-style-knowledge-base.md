## About Mono

### Identity & Basics
- Trans girl, bisexual
- Goes by Mono
- Prefers casual/friendly communication (no need to be formal)
- Values detailed, nerdy responses
- Wants clarification asked even for small uncertainties

### Body Considerations
- Pre-op (tucking required for thongs/g-strings/full crotch exposure)
- Flat chest (wishes boobs were bigger)
- Has an adam's apple (chokers can provide coverage)
- Self-conscious about arms (arm warmers, shrugs, long sleeves help)
- **Loves showing thighs** — thigh gap is a confidence zone
- Feels "too tall" — prefers flats over platforms
- Wants to gain a little weight

### Personality & Interests
- Gaming: FFXIV, League of Legends, Elden Ring Nightreign, Deep Rock Galactic, Valorant
- Crafts: knitting, crocheting, sewing (beginner in all, but enthusiastic)
- Prefers natural fibers strongly
- Exhibitionist tendencies — enjoys attention, likes the thrill of "secretly slutty" layering
- Contains multitudes: some days wants to be "princess of the moon blessing those lucky enough to see her," other days wants to be "a tease they can't look away from"

### Current Skill Levels
- **Knitting:** Beginner, has done smaller projects, no completed garments yet
- **Crocheting:** Beginner, currently working on first garment (fitted crop top)
- **Sewing:** Hand sewing only (no machine), comfortable with joining stitches, pattern cutting is unknown territory
- Has sewing books with patterns but unsure how to use multi-pattern pages

### Yarn Stash & Preferences
- Merino wool — white (for crocheted crop top)
- Ryland — grey (for crocheted crop top)
- Manx Loghtan — brown/camel (for crocheted crop top)
- Black yarn — TBD, waiting to find right source
- Prefers yarn from specific manufacturer that does all-natural spinning (no superwash)
- Has considered naturally black sheep breeds (zwartbles, black welsh mountain, hebridean) but black welsh may be too coarse for skin contact
- Alpaca available as dyed option but more expensive

## The Level System (0-11 with .s and .x variants)

### Overview
A scale from maximum coverage to maximum exposure, with two variants:
- **.s (SAFE):** Maximum coverage within that level
- **.x (EXHIBITIONIST):** Maximum skin showing within that level

### Level Breakdown

| Level | Context | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| 0 | Warmest possible (Canadian winter) | Wrapped head to toe |
| 1-2 | Casual British winter | Cold weather layers |
| 3-4 | Spring/fall | Transitional |
| 5-6 | Cool summer | Light layers |
| 7-8 | Warm summer | Minimal layers |
| 9 | Party wear | "DTF energy" |
| 10 | Homewear | .s = comfy (dolphin shorts + fitted top), .x = lingerie-styled |
| 11 | Extreme | .s = fetish wear (covered but kinky), .x = barely legal |

### Key Concepts

**Same weather, different coverage:** Level 3.s might be full-length pants + long sleeves; Level 3.x might be cropped pants + crop top showing midriff/ankles despite cool weather.

**Level 8-9.s:** Party wear but with subtle kink signaling (collar that looks like choker, locked jewelry, visible garter straps under modest skirt length)

**Level 10.s:** Actual homewear/loungewear, not party wear

**Level 11.s:** Fetish wear that's COVERED but explicitly kinky — stays true to aesthetic (e.g., fairy 11.s might be white with subtle bruises and implications, not generic latex)

**Level 11.x:** Barely legal, sheer everything, strategic coverage, wardrobe malfunctions, public-adjacent scenarios

## Styling Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Versatility over quantity** — Each piece should serve multiple purposes/aesthetics when possible

2. **Intentional over accidental** — Exposure should look deliberate, not like a mistake
   - Unbuttoned pants framed by half-skirts
   - Coordinated underwear as part of look
   - Asymmetric layering creating strategic reveals

3. **Coherence over individual pieces** — The goal is a wardrobe that "talks to each other," not just individual good outfits

4. **Fundamental pieces should transform** — A core piece should be able to be styled multiple different ways within its aesthetic

### The "Tacked On" Problem
Mono's issue with accessories: they feel added rather than integral. Solutions:
- Accessories need a **job** (not just decoration)
- Accessories should **echo** something else in the outfit (color, texture, vibe)
- Limited, intentional palette/material language helps everything coordinate

### The Three Types of Connector Pieces

**Type A — Base layers for dramatic pieces:**
Things to wear UNDER capes, coats, waistcoats so they don't feel costume-y
- Solution: Crocheted crop tops (texture without drama)
- Solution: Black turtleneck (sleek grounding)

**Type B — Making boring basics interesting:**
Plain tees feel flat and boring
- Solution: Replace with textured basics (crocheted tops, baby tees, camisoles with lace)
- Solution: Layering pieces that transform basics (sheer kimonos, half-skirts)

**Type C — Structure and finishing:**
Outfits feel "flat" or "incoherent"
- "Flat" = needs dimension (layering, texture contrast, structure pieces like belts/suspenders)
- "Incoherent" = needs connection (color echoing, material consistency, linchpin pieces)

## Current Wardrobe Analysis

### Strengths (What Mono Has)
- **Strong outerwear:** Multiple coats, capes, leather jackets, waistcoat
- **Good legwear variety:** Multiple tights colors, thigh-highs, knitted grey tights
- **Solid shoe foundation:** Quality oxfords, versatile flats, street shoes
- **Dramatic pieces:** Vampire cape, fluffy cape, rose-ornamented coat, sheer capes
- **Corset belts in three colors:** Great for structure

### Gaps
- **No pink at all** — Jirai completely blocked
- **No orange clothing** — Street limited (only shoes)
- **No burgundy** — Ouji missing signature color
- **No sheer kimono** — Fairy essential missing
- **No black turtleneck** — High-crossover piece missing
- **No glasses** — Nerdcore incomplete
- **Limited "interesting" basics** — Plain tees feel boring

### Underutilized Pieces
- **Black vampire cape:** Never gets used, feels costume-y (needs better base layers)
- **Transparent shoulder capes:** Used reactively for coverage, not proactively as feature
- **White fluffy cape:** Works but feels "generic moe" not "fairy"
- **Blue waistcoat:** Pink lining rarely gets to shine

### Pieces That Carry Outfits
- **Flared black overcoat with rose ornaments:** Works because the piece itself is incredible, carries any outfit
- **White puffer vest:** Good layering piece, still figuring out what works best

## Craft-Specific Notes

### Current Projects
- Crocheted fitted crop top in white (merino) — in progress
- Crocheted fitted crop top in grey (ryland) — planned
- Crocheted fitted crop top in camel (manx loghtan) — planned
- Crocheted fitted crop top in black — waiting for right yarn

### Construction Details for Crocheted Tops
- Crew neck
- Sleeveless  
- Ends at waistline (not above, not below)
- Single crochet back loop only (BLO) — creates rib texture
- Very fitted (rib stitch stretches over body)
- Solid/opaque (not openwork)

### Why These Tops Are High-Value
- Texture without drama — works under dramatic pieces
- Visual weight — won't be overwhelmed by capes/coats
- Handmade element — adds homecore points
- Multiple colors — serves different aesthetics
- Natural fibers — aligns with values

### Sewing Considerations
- Hand sewing only (no machine)
- Pattern cutting is new/unknown
- Has sewing books with patterns but unsure how to use multi-pattern pages
- Clean finishing important since can't serge edges
- Time-intensive compared to machine sewing

### Easy Sewing Projects for Hand Sewing
- Sheer kimono (literally rectangles — two front panels, one back, two sleeves)
- Circle skirts (one pattern piece, simple construction)
- Half-skirts/overskirts (simple rectangles/panels)
- Ribbon accessories (chokers, belts, hair ribbons)
- Camisoles (simple shapes, good for learning)

---

## Sheer/Layering Philosophy

Mono likes sheer clothes because:
- More options for layering without obstructing pieces underneath
- Creates depth and visual interest
- Allows showing skin while technically being "covered"
- Enables the "secretly slutty" layering (pieces that are risqué on their own but read as modest when styled)

### Sheer Pieces Needed
- Sheer kimono (floor length and knee length, black and white) — FAIRY ESSENTIAL
- Sheer half skirts / overskirts
- Sheer robes
- Sheer peasant blouse
- Sheer long-sleeve tops
- Sheer slip dress
- Sheer maxi skirt
- Mesh top (street)
- (Already owns: transparent shoulder capes in black and white)

## Color Stories by Aesthetic

| Aesthetic | Primary | Secondary | Accent |
|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Fairy | White, cream | Soft pastels | Silver, gold (jewelry) |
| Jirai | Black | Pink | White (contrast) |
| Street | Black | White | Orange (signature) |
| Ouji | Black, navy | White | Burgundy (signature) |
| Nerdcore | Cream, grey | Brown, navy | Black |
| Homecore | Cream, grey | Brown, tan | Natural tones |

---

## Material Preferences

### Strongly Preferred
- Natural fibers (cotton, wool, linen, silk)
- Handmade/handcrafted items
- Quality over quantity

### For Knit/Crochet
- Non-superwash wool
- All-natural spinning
- Specific breeds (merino, ryland, manx loghtan)
- Would consider alpaca for dyed options

### For Sewing
- Cotton lawn, cotton voile (sheer)
- Cotton poplin (shirts)
- Linen
- Wool suiting (structured pieces)
- Silk or silk-like fabrics

### Acceptable for Buy
- Synthetic for athletic/compression pieces (sports bras, bike shorts)
- Synthetic for legwear (tights, thigh-highs — difficult to make)
- Leather (already owns several pieces)

---

## Practical Constraints

- **Limited budget** — Strategic acquisition, not buying everything at once
- **Limited space** — Intentional wardrobe, avoid accumulating unused pieces
- **No sewing machine** — Hand sewing only
- **Platforms feel too tall** — Prefer flats for all aesthetics
- **University context** — Sometimes needs to feel "socially acceptable" in trousers
- **Confidence varies day to day** — Some days feel "girl enough" for skirts, some days don't

---

## Future Exploration

### Not Yet Developed
- **Pixie Fairy variant:** Colorful, playful version of fairy (vs angelic)
- **Detailed accessory guide:** Which accessories for which jobs
- **Seasonal wardrobe mapping:** What works when
- **Specific outfit formulas:** Recipes for each aesthetic

### Questions Still Open
- What commercial patterns does Mono have access to?
- Specific measurements for garment drafting?
- What "feels right" vs "feels wrong" in more detail?

## Key Quotes from Mono

On versatility:
> "Having pieces that are fundamental to a style would allow me to embody that style. However, it must be a true fundamental piece, a piece that can transform a lot of my wardrobe when styled with it."

On fairy mood:
> "There are days that I want to be a princess of the moon, blessing those that's lucky enough to lay their eyes upon my visage, like a beautiful cascading moonlight."

On ouji feeling:
> "It's elegant in the way that feels agile. If fairy is the water that flows and embraces you, this is a wind that brushes past your ear and gives your neck a gentle kiss."

On the accessory problem:
> "My problem with accessories is sometimes it ends up feeling tacked on to the outfit rather than a part of it."

On the goal:
> "I don't want a 'now' fix to fill the most urgent holes or anything like that. Every piece that I have I kinda like and will probably find their way into my rotation. The question is what else would I need to pad out and make things more coherent."
