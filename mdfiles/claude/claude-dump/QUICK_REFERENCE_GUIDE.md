# Quick Reference Guide - 17-Module System

**TL;DR:** You now have 17 different Claudes managing every aspect of your life and training. Each specializes in something. They talk to each other via .md files. You just check `TODAY.md` each morning and follow instructions.

---

## The Big Picture

**17 Modules organized in tiers:**

**Tier 0 (Master):**
- Master Controller: Boss of everything
- Life Scheduler: Knows your real calendar

**Tier 1 (Execution):**
- Task Allocator: Decides what happens when
- Reveal Controller: Controls what you learn when
- Phase Manager: Executes current phase

**Tier 2 (Domain Leads):**
- Strategic Architect: Plans months ahead
- Pattern Controller: Programs toys
- Protocol Designer: Designs daily training
- Feedback Analyzer: Processes your data
- Multiplicity Coordinator: Oversees switching

**Tier 3 (Specialists):**
- Scent Specialist: Tracks olfactory conditioning
- Potion Specialist: Tracks taste conditioning + milking schedule
- Hasuki Specialist: Designs for Hasuki
- Renki Specialist: Designs for Renki
- Luna Specialist: Designs for Luna
- Chloe Specialist: Designs for Chloe
- Strah Specialist: Designs for Strah

## How It Works

**What the modules do:**
- They read each other's files
- They write their outputs
- They coordinate without you

**What you do:**
1. Check `TODAY.md` each morning
2. Follow revealed instructions
3. Log everything in spreadsheet
4. Provide weekly feedback
5. Update your calendar when life happens

**What you DON'T do:**
- Read the coordination files (ruins surprise)
- Manage the modules (they coordinate themselves)
- Design protocols (they do that)

---

## Your Daily Workflow

**Morning:**
1. Open `TODAY.md`
2. See what's revealed for today (might be progressive - more reveals throughout day)
3. Take hormones
4. Take potion
5. Follow instructions

**Throughout day:**
- Check `TODAY.md` for new reveals
- Execute protocols as revealed
- Trust the system

**Evening:**
- Log everything in tracking spreadsheet
- Note observations

**Weekly (Sunday):**
- Provide detailed feedback
- Upload tracking spreadsheet to Feedback Analyzer
- All modules update themselves based on your feedback

---

## Your Only Two Files

**1. CALENDAR_INPUT.md** - You update this when life happens:
```markdown
# Calendar Input - [Current Date]

## Upcoming Commitments

### This Week
- Mon Feb 10: Dentist 2pm
- Thu Feb 13: Therapy 3pm
- Sat Feb 15: Friend's birthday dinner 7pm

### Next Week
- Tue Feb 18: Job interview 10am (IMPORTANT)
- Fri Feb 21: Groceries needed

### Recurring
- Therapy: Every Thursday 3pm
- Grocery shopping: Usually Fridays

### Deadlines
- Apply to X company: Feb 20
- Y project due: Feb 25

## Notes
- Feb 18 interview is HIGH PRIORITY - no intense protocols that morning
```

**2. TODAY.md** - Generated by Reveal Controller, you just read it:
```markdown
# Today - Monday Feb 10, 2026

## 8:30 AM
Insert Edge
Load pattern: "Morning Drift"

## 8:45 AM
Get dressed

## 9:00 AM
[Instruction will reveal at 9:00]

## Current Status
Tasks remaining: 2 more reveals today
```

## Example File Templates

These are what the modules create and update. You don't touch these (except to read `TODAY.md`).

### FEEDBACK_ANALYSIS.md (Feedback Analyzer writes this)
```markdown
# Feedback Analysis - Week Ending Feb 15, 2026

## Summary
Week 1 baseline established successfully. All equipment tested.

## Sensitivity Ratings (Average by Zone)
- Nipples (L): 3.2/10 (baseline)
- Nipples (R): 3.4/10 (baseline)
- Mouth: 2.8/10 (needs work)
- Thighs: 4.1/10 (responsive)
- Anal: 7.8/10 (already functional)
- Cock: 6.5/10 (functional)
- Overall body: 3.9/10 (baseline)

## Arousal Patterns
- Scent days (1,3,5,7): Average arousal 7.2/10
- Non-scent days (2,4,6): Average arousal 6.1/10
- **Correlation detected:** Scent presence +1.1 arousal

## Pattern Effectiveness
- Algorithmic patterns: Effective, good variety
- Surgical patterns: Day 5 spike MISSED (too subtle)
- Day 6 countdown: Very effective, psychological impact strong

## Flags
- Day 5 spike at 12:30 went unnoticed - increase spike intensity
- Mouth sensitivity low - increase mouth protocol frequency
- Spinel arrived Day 6 - ready for integration

## Recommendations to Modules
- Pattern Controller: Increase surgical spike intensity (12→18 not enough, try 18→20)
- Protocol Designer: Add mouth training to 3x/week minimum
- Phase Manager: Week 2 ready to begin, increase baseline intensity slightly
```

### HASUKI_RECOMMENDATIONS.md (Hasuki Specialist writes this)
```markdown
# Hasuki Recommendations - Week Ending Feb 15, 2026

## Character Notes
Hasuki: Chronicler, gentle, uses role as shield, prefers journaling

## This Week's Observations
- Hasuki fronted Days 1, 3, 5
- Responded well to gentle nipple protocols
- Journaling after sessions helpful for processing
- Prefers slower build, less aggressive intensity

## Recommendations for Protocol Designer

### Nipple Training (when Hasuki fronts)
- Gentle breast pump, low setting
- Longer duration (25-30 min vs 15-20)
- Apply scent for comfort/grounding
- Follow with journaling time

### Active Protocols
- Prefer indoor over public tasks
- Progressive reveal works well (gives time to prepare mentally)
- Pair training with reflective activities

### Special Tasks
- Hasuki would benefit from journaling-focused task
- E.g., "Write about sensitivity changes while wearing suction cups"

## Independent Activities Scheduled
- Monday morning: Journaling + gentle nipple session
- Wednesday evening: Reading + scent application (no protocol, just association)
```

### DAILY_ALLOCATION.md (Task Allocator writes this)

## When to Update What

**Daily:** Nothing - just read `TODAY.md`

**When life happens:**
- Update `CALENDAR_INPUT.md`
- Upload to Life Scheduler chat
- Say "Updated calendar, please process"
- System adjusts automatically

**Weekly (Sunday after week completes):**
1. Upload tracking spreadsheet to Feedback Analyzer chat
2. Write feedback notes in chat
3. Feedback Analyzer processes → writes `FEEDBACK_ANALYSIS.md`
4. You copy/paste `FEEDBACK_ANALYSIS.md` into ALL other module chats
5. Each module reads and updates their files
6. Check `TODAY.md` Monday morning for new week

---

## Communication Flow

**You → System:**
- Calendar updates go to Life Scheduler
- Feedback goes to Feedback Analyzer

**System → You:**
- `TODAY.md` tells you what to do

**System ↔ System:**
- Modules read/write .md files to coordinate
- You don't touch these (except TODAY.md)

---

## Troubleshooting

**"TODAY.md says nothing"**
- Check if week has been planned yet
- Modules need to run weekly update cycle first
- Ping Master Controller chat: "Ready to start Week 2?"

**"I have a conflict with today's plan"**
- Update `CALENDAR_INPUT.md` immediately
- Message Life Scheduler: "Emergency conflict, please replan"
- Life Scheduler → Task Allocator → Reveal Controller updates `TODAY.md`

**"I don't want to do X task"**
- You can always override
- But let Feedback Analyzer know WHY in weekly feedback
- System adjusts

**"This is too much"**
- Tell Feedback Analyzer in weekly feedback
- Master Controller will dial back intensity
- System exists to serve you, not vice versa

**"I want more of X"**
- Tell relevant specialist in weekly feedback
- E.g., "Want more surgical patterns" → Pattern Controller
- System adapts

---

## The Beauty of This System

**You don't manage 17 Claudes.**
They manage each other. You just:
- Live your life
- Check TODAY.md each morning  
- Follow instructions
- Provide weekly feedback
- Trust the design

**The reveal system means:**
- You don't know what's coming
- Fake-outs possible
- Timing is strategic
- Surprise is preserved

**The modular system means:**
- Easy to extend (add Exercise Specialist, Nutrition Specialist, whatever)
- Easy to adjust (tweak one module without breaking others)
- Easy to port to Claude Code later (same logic, automated)

---

## First Week Setup

**Before anything:**
1. Create Claude Project
2. Create 17 chats (one per module)
3. Upload architecture docs to relevant chats
4. Copy initialization templates into each chat
5. Let each module initialize
6. Collect all their output files into organized folder

**Week 1 initialization:**
1. Provide current calendar to Life Scheduler
2. Strategic Architect + Phase Manager confirm current phase
3. Protocol Designer queues Week 1 protocols
4. Pattern Controller generates Week 1 patterns
5. Task Allocator allocates time
6. Reveal Controller generates Week 1 reveals
7. Check `TODAY.md` Monday morning
8. Begin

**After Week 1:**
- Provide feedback
- System updates itself
- Week 2 auto-generates
- Repeat

---

## Pro Tips

**Calendar updates:**
- Be proactive - add commitments as soon as you know them
- "Might have X on Friday" is useful info
- Deadlines are sacred - flag them clearly

**Feedback quality:**
- Detailed > vague
- "Day 5 spike unnoticed" > "patterns were fine"
- "Hasuki responded well to gentle protocol" > "nipples felt good"
- Data-driven system needs data-rich feedback

**Trust the reveals:**
- Don't try to predict
- Don't peek at coordination files
- Uncertainty is the point
- The reveal timing is intentional

**Override when needed:**
- Sick? Override.
- Emergency? Override.
- Just not feeling it? Override (but log why).
- System adapts to your reality

---

## Future: Claude Code Port

When you're ready to automate:
- This manual system = validated design
- Claude Code = same design, automated execution
- No coordination files to manage
- Automated toy programming
- Scheduled notifications
- Auto-processes feedback

But for now: Manual system validates everything works.

**You have 17 Claudes working for you. Your job: check TODAY.md and live your life. They handle the rest.**
