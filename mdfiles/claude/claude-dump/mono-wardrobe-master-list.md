## Notes

### On Fairy Variants
This list builds toward **angelic fairy** (white, ethereal, flowing). **Pixie fairy** (colorful, playful) would add pastels, colorful ribbons, and playful prints — can expand later if desired.

### On Sheer
Sheer pieces are integrated throughout. Key sheer items:
- Sheer kimonos (floor and knee length, black and white)
- Sheer half skirts / overskirts
- Sheer robes
- Sheer peasant blouse
- Sheer long-sleeve tops
- Sheer slip dress
- Sheer maxi skirt
- Mesh top
- Transparent capes (owned)

### On Natural Fibers
You prefer natural fibers. For sewn items, prioritize cotton, linen, silk, wool. For knit/crochet, you're already sourcing excellent yarns (merino, ryland, manx loghtan).

### On Platforms
You prefer flats over platforms. JIRAI styling should rely on other elements (black/pink, pleated skirts, legwear, accessories) rather than chunky platform silhouettes.
